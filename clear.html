      The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small,
      typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when
      kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them
      from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for
      companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than
      seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.
